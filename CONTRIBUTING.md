# Contributing to repoctl

English | [简体中文](CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md)

repoctl accepts bug fixes, documentation improvements, tests, and focused feature proposals.

## Development setup

1. Use Node.js 22.12+ and enable Corepack.
2. Run `pnpm install`.
3. Create a focused branch from `main`.
4. Add or update tests with the implementation.

Before opening a pull request, run:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm tsd
pnpm test
```

Changes to publishable packages require a pnpm change intent created with `pnpm change`. Commits must use Conventional Commit syntax.

When changing templates or managed root assets, update their source first and refresh packaged copies with `pnpm --filter @icebreakers/monorepo-templates sync:assets`.

Report bugs at https://github.com/sonofmagic/repoctl/issues and use discussions for design questions that do not yet have a concrete implementation.
